## This project is a refactor of the Discord Bot for the Languages and International Relations Centre for the Toulouse Institute of Technologies Paul Sabatier Universtiry. Everything is developed under Node v20.5.0 and mainly discord.js 14.11.0 module.

The project was initially made in Javascript, but I decided to refactor it in Typescript to make it more readable and maintainable.

## Features

### Automatic System

- 1 ⚙️ Interactive Help Desk with an Assistance Channel
- 2 🗳️ Slash Commands Support / Context Menu
- 3 🖼️ Many Plugin (Toss, Poll, etc.)
- 6 📝 A bunch of fun commands (calculator, dice, status changer, etc.)

### Commands

All the command are repertoried in a proper wiki [here](https://eric-p.gitbook.io/cril-bot-documentation/)

---

## Highly flexible over time

> The bot was built in such a way as to have an architecture to be able to easily evolve over time
